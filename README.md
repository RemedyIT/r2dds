# R2DDS

This repository contains a sample ruby script to read/write ShapeType samples to DDS.

Using the DDS Dynamic API a Ruby language binding for DDS could be developed. A small proof of concept was created using the type specific data reader/writer but that would require C++ code generation for each new IDL defined type. Using the dynamic DDS API an easy to use API to DDS can be created. The ruby language binding could support multiple DDS vendors, there are small differences between each vendor, but those differences could all be kept internal to R2DDS.
