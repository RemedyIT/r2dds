# R2DDS

This repository contains a sample ruby script to read/write ShapeType samples to DDS.

Using the DDS Dynamic API a Ruby language binding for DDS could be developed. A small proof of concept was created using the type specific data reader/writer but that would require C++ code generation for each new IDL defined type.
